I am a Senior Dev at Okta.
Apart from Salesforce/Apex, I like to dabble in Python, Javascript, and BashScript. This repository is a compilation of my side-projects developed to provide utility to my fellow Salesforce developers.

In each folder, there is a README on how to install and use the respective tool.


## Tools
- [Delete Debug Logs Script](https://github.com/shridharpuntambekar-okta/Utility-Projects/tree/master/DeleteDebugLogs) - A short bash script that uses SFDX to delete Salesforce debug logs.
- [All Fields All Record Query Script](https://github.com/shridharpuntambekar-okta/Utility-Projects/tree/master/AllFieldsAllRecordsQuery) - This tool uses python3, SFDX, bash, and jq to query records of requested objects.
- [Retrieve all reports' metadata](https://github.com/shridharpuntambekar-okta/Utility-Projects/tree/master/RetrieveReportsMetadata) - This tool uses python3, bash, and SFDX to automate the querying of "Reports" metadata.
- [Lead Convert File Diff-inator](https://github.com/shridharpuntambekar-okta/Utility-Projects/tree/master/LeadConvertFileDiff) - This tool uses python3 and GIT to untangle and get the field changes in the LeadConvertFile for a Github PR.
